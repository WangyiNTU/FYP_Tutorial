# Final Year Project Tutorials for undergraduate students.

Please find your topic. Try yourself first and seek help from your mentor.

For the details of Pytorch, please refer to [pytorch-tutorial](https://github.com/yunjey/pytorch-tutorial) and [PyTorch-Tutorial](https://github.com/MorvanZhou/PyTorch-Tutorial).

Deep learning-related online courses are recommended like [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning) and [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning). They are free to learn if you do not require the certificates.

Please refer to [The Art of Command Line](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line/blob/master/README.md) for accessing the remote server with GPU.

Thanks to the contributors, Sun Haoran, Hu Qiongyang, Zhu Haoyu, and Qin Hao.
