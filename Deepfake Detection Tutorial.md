##  **2 Deepfake Detection**
### Deepfake detection on videos is a complex task that involves multiple steps, including dataset selection, model selection, training, and evaluation. The following is a structured approach to solve this problem:

### **2.1 Define the Problem**
   #### **2.1.1 Deepfake**: Deepfake is a technique that generates or modifies multimedia content by training deep neural networks to create highly realistic fake videos, audio, or images. Common methods include the following:
   - ##### **FaceSwap**. FaceSwap is a graph-based method for transferring facial regions from a source video to a target video.

   - ##### **Face2Face**. Face2Face is a facial reconstruction system that transfers the expression of a source video to a target video while maintaining the identity of the target person.

   - ##### **Audio-visual Manipulation**. Tampering with the key words of the target person's words in the video and modifying the lip shape.

   #### **2.1.2 Deepfake Detection**: 

   - ##### **Frame Consistency Analysis**. Detects whether there are signs of forgery by analyzing the continuity and consistency between video frames.

   - ##### **Lighting and Shadow Analysis**. Detects inconsistencies in lighting and shadows in the video, as forged videos may have defects in these aspects.

   - ##### **Motion Trajectory Analysis**. Identifies unnatural motion patterns by analyzing the movement trajectory of objects or people in the video.

   - ##### **Audio-video synchronization analysis**. Detects whether the audio and video are synchronized, as forged videos may have problems with synchronization.
### **2.2 Datasets**
#### **2.2.1 Video Deepfake Dataset**: 
- ##### **Face Forensic++**
- ##### **Celeb-DF**
- ##### **Celeb-DFv2**
- ##### **TVIL**
#### **2.2.2 Video-Audio Deepfake Dataset**:
- ##### **DFDC**
- ##### **LAV-DF**
- ##### **FakeAVCeleb**
- ##### **Deepfake1MData**

### **2.3 Preprocessing**
#### **2.3.1 Extract Frames** 
##### Video framing refers to extracting individual frames (i.e. static images) from a video, which is very useful in some deepfake detection methods.
#### **2.3.2 Extract Video Features** 
##### Video feature extraction refers to extracting useful information from video data for further analysis and processing. The extracted information includes spatial features (RGB color space, texture features, edge features) and temporal features (flow).Commonly used feature extraction tools include I3D（https://github.com/piergiaj/pytorch-i3d）, etc.

### **3 Model Selection**
#### **3.1 Vision-transformer** 
##### By splitting the image into blocks and processing it using a standard Transformer encoder.https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer
#### **3.2 Swin-transformer**
##### By introducing a sliding window mechanism and a hierarchical design, the computational complexity problem of ViT when processing high-resolution images is solved, making it suitable for a wider range of visual tasks. https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer
#### **3.3 Vision-mamba**
##### The new Mamba structure has advantages over Transformer in processing long sequences and computational efficiency, but whether Mamba can achieve the versatility and efficiency of Transformer still needs further research and verification. https://github.com/hustvl/Vim

### **4 Model Training**
#### **4.1 Frameworks**
##### Use frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch to build and train your models.
#### **4.2 Loss Functions** 
##### Choose appropriate loss functions for deepfake detection tasks (e.g., cross-entropy loss for classification, mean squared error).
#### **4.3 Training Process** 
##### Split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Train your model using the training set and validate it using the validation set.

### **5 Evaluation**
#### Use metrics such as Average Precision and AUC (Area Under Curve) to evaluate the detection effect of the model

### **6 Deployment**
#### Can be deployed in real-time applications (such as anti-fraud platforms), paying attention to optimizing program processing speed.
